//! `bevy_picking_input` is a thin layer that provides unsurprising default inputs to `bevy_picking
//! core`. The included systems are responsible for sending  mouse and touch inputs to their
//! respective `Pointer`s.
//!
//! Because this resides in its own crate, it's easy to omit it, and provide your own inputs as
//! needed. Because `Pointer`s aren't coupled to the underlying input hardware, you can easily mock
//! inputs, and allow users full accessibility to map whatever inputs they need to pointer input.
//!
//! If, for example, you wanted to add support for VR input, all you need to do is spawn a pointer
//! entity with a custom [`PointerId`](bevy_picking_core::pointer::PointerId), and write a system
//! that updates its position.
