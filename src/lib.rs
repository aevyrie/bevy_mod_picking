//! A flexible set of plugins that add picking functionality to your `bevy` app.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! In the simplest case, this plugin allows you to click on things in the scene. However, it also
//! allows you to express more complex interactions, like detecting when a touch input drags a UI
//! element and drops it on a 3d mesh rendered to a different camera. The crate also provides event
//! listeners, so you can attach `On<Click>` components to an entity, to run a one-shot bevy system.
//!
//! The plugin works with any input, including mouse, touch, pens, or virtual pointers controlled by
//! gamepads. It includes (optional) backends for `rapier`, `bevy_xpbd`, `bevy_mod_raycast`,
//! `bevy_ui`, `bevy_sprite`, and `egui`, that can be mixed and matched out of the box, or you can
//! write your own.
//!
//! At its core, this crate provides a robust abstraction for computing picking state regardless of
//! pointing devices, or what you are hit testing against.
//!
//! ## Expressive Events
//!
//! The plugin provides normal bevy events that can be listened to with `EventReader`s. These
//! [`Pointer`] events allow you to respond to interactions like [`Click`], [`Over`], or [`Drag`]
//! (13 pointer events are provided). However, this often causes boilerplate when you try to do
//! something in response to that click, and you want the behavior to be different depending on the
//! entity being clicked on.
//!
//! This is where event listeners come in. Reacting to these interaction events on a specific entity
//! is made possible with the [`On<Event>`](On) component. When events are generated, they bubble up
//! the entity hierarchy starting from their target, looking for these event listener components.
//! (See [`bevy_eventlistener`] for details.)
//!
//! This allows you to run callbacks when any children of an entity are interacted with, and leads
//! to succinct, expressive code:
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy::ecs::world::Command;
//! # use prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_mod_picking::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_eventlistener::callbacks::ListenerInput;
//! #
//! # struct DeleteTarget;
//! # impl From<ListenerInput<Pointer<Click>>> for DeleteTarget {
//! #     fn from(_: ListenerInput<Pointer<Click>>) -> Self {
//! #         DeleteTarget
//! #     }
//! # }
//! # impl Command for DeleteTarget {
//! #     fn apply(self, world: &mut World) {}
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[derive(Event)]
//! # struct Greeting;
//! # impl From<ListenerInput<Pointer<Over>>> for Greeting {
//! #     fn from(_: ListenerInput<Pointer<Over>>) -> Self {
//! #         Greeting
//! #     }
//! # }
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     commands.spawn((
//!         // Spawn your entity here, e.g. a Mesh.
//!         // When dragged, mutate the `Transform` component on the dragged target entity:
//!         On::<Pointer<Drag>>::target_component_mut::<Transform>(|drag, transform| {
//!             transform.rotate_local_y(drag.delta.x / 50.0)
//!         }),
//!         On::<Pointer<Click>>::add_command::<DeleteTarget>(),
//!         On::<Pointer<Over>>::send_event::<Greeting>(),
//!     ));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you don't need event bubbling or callbacks, you can respond to pointer events like you would
//! any other bevy event, using `EventReader<Pointer<Click>>`, `EventReader<Pointer<Move>>`, etc.
//!
//! ## Modularity
//!
//! #### Mix and Match Hit Testing Backends
//!
//! The plugin attempts to handle all the hard parts for you, all you need to do is tell it when a
//! pointer is hitting any entities. Multiple backends can be used at the same time! [Use this
//! simple API to write your own backend](crate::backend) in about 100 lines of code. The plugin
//! also includes half a dozen backends out of the box. These include `rapier`, `bevy_xpbd`,
//! `bevy_mod_raycast`, `bevy_ui`, `bevy_egui`, and `bevy_sprite`.
//!
//! #### Input Agnostic
//!
//! Pointers can be controlled with anything, whether its the included mouse or touch inputs, or a
//! custom gamepad input system you write yourself to control a virtual pointer.
//!
//! ## Robustness
//!
//! In addition to these features, this plugin also correctly handles multitouch, multiple windows,
//! multiple cameras, viewports, and render layers. Using this as a library allows you to write a
//! picking backend that can interoperate with any other picking backend.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! Making objects pickable is pretty straightforward. In the most minimal cases, it's as simple as:
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! use bevy_mod_picking::prelude::*;
//! # fn setup(
//! #     mut commands: Commands,
//! #     app: &mut App,
//! # ) {
//! App::new()
//!     .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
//!     .add_plugins(DefaultPickingPlugins); // Includes a mesh raycasting backend by default
//!
//! commands.spawn((
//!     PbrBundle::default(),           // The raycasting backend works with meshes
//!     PickableBundle::default(),      // Makes the entity pickable, and adds optional features
//! ));
//!
//! commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle::default());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Next Steps
//!
//! To learn more, take a look at the examples in the
//! [`./examples`](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking/tree/main/examples) directory. You
//! can read the next section to understand how the plugin works.
//!
//! # The Picking Pipeline
//!
//! This plugin is designed to be extremely modular. To do so, it works in well-defined stages that
//! form a pipeline, where events are used to pass data between each stage. All the types needed for
//! the pipeline are defined in the [`bevy_picking_core`] crate.
//!
//! #### Pointers ([`bevy_picking_core::pointer`])
//!
//! The first stage of the pipeline is to gather inputs and update pointers. This stage is
//! ultimately responsible for generating [`InputMove`](bevy_picking_core::pointer::InputMove) and
//! [`InputPress`](bevy_picking_core::pointer::InputPress) events. The provided crate does this
//! automatically for mouse, touch, and pen inputs. If you wanted to implement your own pointer,
//! controlled by some other input, you can do that here.
//!
//! Because pointer positions and presses are driven by these events, you can use them to mock
//! inputs for testing.
//!
//! After inputs are generated, they are then collected to update the current [`PointerLocation`]
//! for each pointer.
//!
//! #### Backend ([`bevy_picking_core::backend`])
//!
//! A picking backend only has one job: reading [`PointerLocation`] components, and producing
//! [`PointerHits`](crate::backend::PointerHits). You can find all documentation and types needed to
//! implement a backend at [`bevy_picking_core::backend`].
//!
//! You will eventually need to choose which picking backend(s) you want to use. This plugin uses
//! `bevy_mod_raycast` for 3d by default; it works with bevy `Mesh`es out of the box and requires no
//! extra dependencies. These qualities make it useful when prototyping, however it might not be
//! performant enough for your use case. Consider switching to the rapier backend if performance
//! becomes a problem or if you already have the dependency in-tree. For many games, it may never be
//! an issue. You can find all the provided backends in the [`backends`] module.
//!
//! It's important to understand that you can mix and match backends! For example, you might have a
//! backend for your UI, and one for the 3d scene, with each being specialized for their purpose.
//! This crate provides some backends out of the box, but you can even write your own. It's been
//! made as easy as possible intentionally; the `bevy_mod_raycast` backend is 50 lines of code.
//!
//! #### Focus ([`bevy_picking_core::focus`])
//!
//! The next step is to use the data from the backends, combine and sort the results, and determine
//! what each cursor is hovering over, producing a [`HoverMap`](`crate::focus::HoverMap`). Note that
//! just because a pointer is over an entity, it is not necessarily *hovering* that entity. Although
//! multiple backends may be reporting that a pointer is hitting an entity, the focus system needs
//! to determine which entities are actually being hovered by this pointer based on the pick depth,
//! order of the backend, and the [`Pickable`] state of the entity. In other words, if one entity is
//! in front of another, usually only the topmost one will be hovered.
//!
//! #### Events ([`bevy_picking_core::events`])
//!
//! In the final step, the high-level pointer events are generated, such as events that trigger when
//! a pointer hovers or clicks an entity. These simple events are then used to generate more complex
//! events for dragging and dropping. Once all events have been generated, the event bubbling
//! systems propagate events through the entity hierarchy, triggering [`On<E>`] callbacks.
//!
//! Because it is completely agnostic to the the earlier stages of the pipeline, you can easily
//! extend the plugin with arbitrary backends and input methods, yet still use all the high level
//! features.
